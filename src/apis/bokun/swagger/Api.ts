/**
 * This object mimics Java's `java.math.RoundingMode`:
 * * `UP` - Rounding mode to round away from zero. Always increments the digit prior to a non-zero discarded
 *   fraction. Note that this rounding mode never decreases the magnitude of the calculated value.
 * * `DOWN` - Rounding mode to round towards zero. Never increments the digit prior to a discarded fraction (i.e.,
 *   truncates). Note that this rounding mode never increases the magnitude of the calculated value.
 * * `CEILING` - Rounding mode to round towards positive infinity. If the result is positive, behaves as for `UP`;
 *   if negative, behaves as for `DOWN`. Note that this rounding mode never decreases the calculated value.
 * * `FLOOR` - Rounding mode to round towards negative infinity. If the result is positive, behave as for `DOWN`;
 *   if negative, behave as for `UP`. Note that this rounding mode never increases the calculated value.
 * * `HALF_UP` - Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which
 *   case round up. Behaves as for `UP` if the discarded fraction is â‰¥ 0.5; otherwise, behaves as for `DOWN`. Note
 *   that this is the rounding mode commonly taught at school.
 * * `HALF_DOWN` - Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in
 *   which case round down. Behaves as for `UP` if the discarded fraction is > 0.5; otherwise, behaves as for
 *   `DOWN`.
 * * `HALF_EVEN` - Rounding mode to round towards the "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in
 *   which case, round towards the even neighbor. Behaves as for `HALF_UP` if the digit to the left of the
 *   discarded fraction is odd; behaves as for `HALF_DOWN` if it's even. Note that this is the rounding mode that
 *   statistically minimizes cumulative error when applied repeatedly over a sequence of calculations. It is
 *   sometimes known as "Banker's rounding," and is chiefly used in the USA.
 * * `UNNECESSARY` - Rounding mode to assert that the requested operation has an exact result, hence no rounding
 *   is necessary.

   * * `FLOOR` - Rounding mode to round towards negative infinity. If the result is positive, behave as for `DOWN`;
   *   if negative, behave as for `UP`. Note that this rounding mode never increases the calculated value.
   * * `HALF_UP` - Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which
   *   case round up. Behaves as for `UP` if the discarded fraction is â‰¥ 0.5; otherwise, behaves as for `DOWN`. Note
   *   that this is the rounding mode commonly taught at school.
   * * `HALF_DOWN` - Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in
   *   which case round down. Behaves as for `UP` if the discarded fraction is > 0.5; otherwise, behaves as for
   *   `DOWN`.
   * * `HALF_EVEN` - Rounding mode to round towards the "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in
   *   which case, round towards the even neighbor. Behaves as for `HALF_UP` if the digit to the left of the
   *   discarded fraction is odd; behaves as for `HALF_DOWN` if it's even. Note that this is the rounding mode that
   *   statistically minimizes cumulative error when applied repeatedly over a sequence of calculations. It is
   *   sometimes known as "Banker's rounding," and is chiefly used in the USA.

/**
 * @title BÃ³kun RESTful web services
 * @version 2.0.160
 * @baseUrl https://api.bokuntest.com
 * @externalDocs https://bokun.io
 * @contact <api@bokun.is>
 *
 * These web services are a second generation of BÃ³kun's RESTful API offerings. Initially they will have a list of new services, such as marketplace access etc. but the eventual plan is to add selected [v1 counterparts](https://bokun.github.io/api-docs/). As of now, you may use both v1 and v2 interchangeably; as the same API keys should work for both versions.
 *
 * **Data types**
 *
 * DTOs used in these services have the following rules for data types:
 *
 *   - always use UTC timestamp (number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) for date & time objects; provide timezone context in a separate field where appropriate
 *   - use Swagger native string/date for date-only fields; provide timezone context in a separate field where appropriate
 *   - always use strings for monetary/commission amounts, never use float or double. Please refer to [Java BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)) for more details.
 *
 * **Backwards compatibility policy**
 *
 * We take backwards compatibility seriously and pledge to the following policy:
 *
 *   - existing URL endpoints will not be removed without sensible sunset warning, but any new new endpoints may be added without prior notice
 *   - existing attributes in DTOs will not be removed, but new attributes and/or DTO types may be added without prior notice
 *   - established input names and types (path elements, query parameters) of existing endpoints will not be removed, but a more flexible rules may be applied in case if such endpoint is changed without prior notice
 *   - types of established DTO attributes will not change
 *   - mandatory DTO attributes will not be removed but in case if field becomes no longer mandatory, some default value will be sent
 *   - each minor/backwards compatible API change will result a minor version increase, e.g. `v2.0.1` -> `v.2.0.2`
 *   - each major/backwards incompatible API change (if any) will result a new set of endpoints/DTOs and will major/middle version increase, e.g. `v2.0.1` -> `v.3.0.0` or `v2.0.1` -> `v.2.1.0`
 *   - generated .class files for DTO objects will reflect the version name without minor component, e.g. v2.0.9 will be placed in `io.bokun.rest.v2_0` package
 *   - we do not provide any guarantees over the ordering of DTO JSON siblings (attributes at the same JSON object level). Assume that order may change at any time
 *   - DTO attributes with null values and absent attributes are semantically equal. We will always prefer the absence but the receiving end must be able to handle nulls if they appear
 *   - for array types, we generally aim to keep empty arrays for DTO access convenience but don't assume this will be held universally
 *   - for inherited types (`allOf`), we reserve the right to promote attributes in DTO objects up the inheritance hierarchy without prior notice
 *   - we will not remove elements from enums without prior notice but reserve the right to add new elements in
 *
 * Some useful links:
